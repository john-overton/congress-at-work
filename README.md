# Congress-at-Work Repository

## Description

This repository hosts the [@congressatwork](https://x.com/congressatwork) X bot, designed to make congressional information more accessible to the public. While congressional work and data are publicly available, they can be difficult to digest. Our data scraping bot extracts key information from [Congress.gov](https://www.congress.gov/) APIs and public web pages.

### The bot's primary goals are to:

1. Provide approachable, unbiased information
2. Keep people informed without noise or opinion
3. Make congressional data readily available, free, and open-source

Using AI tools, this bot distills complex legislation into useful, easily understandable formats for public consumption.
